## [Tada / Socar] Business Development and Strategic Planning
### (2019.10 ~ 2021.02)

Mobility is essential to human life. The mission of Tada / Socar is to make everyone's transportation more convenient and ultimately shift the paradigm of vehicle ownership to vehicle sharing. Potential competitors of Tada / Socar would be automobile manufacturers.

While working here, I contributed to some notable partnerships with Naver, Hyundai Card, VISA, and Volkswagen (See below). Afterwards, I contributed to the restructuring of new business of Socar (long-term and P2P sharing) and the planning of medium-to-long term strategies, including IVI (In-vehicle Infortainment).
