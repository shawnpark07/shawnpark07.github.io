# [TADA / SOCAR]
[TADA]([url](https://tadatada.com/)), a phenomenal ride hailing service based on South Korea, which gathered 1.7 M users and created 20 K driver jobs in just one year from the launch. Though legally vindicated, the business suffered disruptions due to biased legislation by the National Assembly.

## Business Development and Strategic Planning

Mobility is essential to human life. The mission of TADA / SOCAR is to make everyone's transportation more convenient and ultimately shift the paradigm of vehicle ownership to vehicle sharing. Potential competitors of TADA / SOCAR would be automobile manufacturers.

While working here, I contributed to some notable partnerships with Naver, Hyundai Card, VISA, and Volkswagen (See below). Afterwards, I contributed to the restructuring of new business of Socar (long-term and P2P sharing) and the planning of medium-to-long term strategies, including IVI (In-vehicle Infortainment).

N-CEO is a group of individuals who aspire to become the next generation of global leaders. From its day 1 to the present, all members deeply empathize with N-CEO's four core values (Dream, Leadership, Responsibility, Trust & Support) and strive to practice them in their life. Through activities such as joint projects with companies such as Hyundai Motor, WeMakePrice, Fursys, and K-Bank, we cultivated the basics of entrepreneurship.
