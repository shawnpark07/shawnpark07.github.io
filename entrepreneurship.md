## [TADA / SOCAR]
[TADA]([url](https://tadatada.com/)), a phenomenal ride-hailing service based on South Korea, which gathered 1.7 M users and created 20 K driver jobs in just one year from the launch. Though legally vindicated, the business suffered disruptions due to biased legislation by the National Assembly. The story has been made as [a documentary]([url](https://zdnet.co.kr/view/?no=20210915081331)) on Netflix.

## (2019.10 ~ 2021.02) Business Development and Strategic Planning

Mobility is essential to human life. The mission of TADA / SOCAR is to make everyone's transportation more convenient and ultimately shift the paradigm of vehicle ownership to vehicle sharing. Potential competitors of TADA / SOCAR would be automobile manufacturers.
