# TADA / SOCAR
[TADA]([url](https://tadatada.com/)), a phenomenal ride hailing service based on South Korea, which gathered 1.7 M users and created 20 K driver jobs in just one yar from the launch. Though legally vindicated, the business suffered disruptions due to biased legislation by the National Assembly. The story has been made as [a documentary]([url](https://zdnet.co.kr/view/?no=20210915081331)) on Netflix.

[SOCAR]([url](https://www.socar.kr/)), the No.1 Car-sharing company based on both South Korea and Malaysia, also once was the mother company of TADA. SOCAR occupies over 75% of market share, and has own fundamental with its 7.0 M user base.


## [TADA] Business Development and Strategic Planning
### (2019.10 ~ 2021.02)

Mobility is essential to human life. The mission of TADA / SOCAR is to make everyone's transportation more convenient and ultimately shift the paradigm of vehicle ownership to vehicle sharing. Potential competitors of TADA / SOCAR would be automobile manufacturers.

While working here, I contributed to some notable partnerships with Naver, Hyundai Card, VISA, and Volkswagen (See below). Afterwards, I contributed to the restructuring of new business of Socar (long-term and P2P sharing) and the planning of medium-to-long term strategies, including IVI (In-vehicle Infortainment).
